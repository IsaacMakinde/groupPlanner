                <p>
                  I was presented with the opportunity to build a full-stack
                  application using Angular that would handle basic CRUD
                  operations, with a design aesthetic inspired by Ticketmaster's
                  UI. Intrigued by the challenge, I decided to take on the task,
                  seeing it as a perfect chance to apply and expand my skills in
                  front-end development, particularly with Angular.
                </p>
                <p className="has-text-black">
                  To build the application, I used Bulma CSS to create a clean,
                  modern design quickly and efficiently. For state management,
                  Redux ensured smooth data flow across components, enhancing
                  the app's responsiveness. I set up a mock API with
                  simple-json-server to handle basic CRUD operations, simulating
                  a real back-end. Finally, I utilized Nodemon to automate
                  server reloads during development, streamlining the testing
                  process. Together, these tools enabled me to create a
                  functional, visually appealing application that met all
                  project requirements.

                <p>
                  Josephu is a web application designed to serve as a personal
                  website for a YouTuber, providing users with access to
                  exclusive content and showcasing previous collaborations with
                  other creators. The platform also features a 'Contact Me'
                  page, intended to facilitate further collaborations and
                  engagement with the YouTuberâ€™s audience and peers. The primary
                  goal was to create a professional yet accessible space to
                  connect with fans and collaborators alike.

                <p className="has-text-black">
                  This project was built without a backend, focusing solely on
                  practicing fundamental CSS techniques and ensuring responsive
                  design for mobile devices. The application served as a
                  hands-on exercise in crafting visually appealing layouts and
                  adaptable designs, with the long-term intent of developing it
                  into a functional personal website for fostering
                  collaborations and audience interaction.

                <p>
                  Country Wiki is an application I was tasked with developing,
                  designed to fetch and display relevant information about
                  countries using the Country API. The goal was to provide a
                  clean and uniform interface for users to search for and
                  explore detailed data about various countries. To achieve a
                  polished and consistent look, I utilized BulmaCSS, a framework
                  I was keen to learn at the time, which allowed for quick and
                  professional styling across the application.
                </p>
                <p className="has-text-black">
                  On the backend, I implemented an API using Express and
                  Node.js, adhering to the MVC architecture to ensure a clear
                  separation of concerns and maintainability. This project
                  provided a great opportunity to practice structuring a backend
                  efficiently while integrating a third-party API. By combining
                  these tools and techniques, I was able to create a functional
                  and visually appealing application that met the project
                  requirements.

                <p>
                  Store B was an Android application that my partner and I
                  conceptualized for our fourth-year project. The idea was to
                  create a social scanning system for mobile devices, aiming to
                  replace the handheld scanners commonly used in stores like
                  Tesco. This innovative concept sought to enhance user
                  convenience and efficiency in retail environments by
                  leveraging mobile technology. The original project served as a
                  foundation for exploring advanced development techniques and
                  practical applications of software in real-world scenarios.
                </p>
                <p className="has-text-black">
                  Later, I decided to revisit and remake the project using the
                  MVVM architecture to improve maintainability and scalability.
                  I integrated web scraping and Firebase to enhance
                  functionality and used a tech stack that included Android,
                  Express, Python, and a MySQL database. However, due to the
                  significant workload and my lack of confidence in my skills at
                  the time, I ultimately had to abandon the project. This
                  experience taught me valuable lessons about project scope,
                  time management, and the importance of incremental progress in
                  tackling ambitious ideas.
